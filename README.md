# ABOUT

This repo contains template for projects I use. Template includes:
- Makefile for building the projects(multi hardware builds and RTOS are supported)
- Readme file
- License file
- Git ignore file
- Project structures
- Set of coding rules I follow in embedded software development


# PROJECT APPLICATION STRUCTURE

**This part applies only to firmware projects.**

<p align="center">
  <img src=".backend/Project%20structure.png" alt="Project application structure diagram" title="Project application structure diagram" />
</p>

Diagram shows project structure. It goes from the base up.

### Hardware

The base for every project. It runs the project.

### Drivers

Drivers are the gate for other layers of the application to interact with the hardware. They are written with minimal logic inside. Every driver is wirrten without other driver(s). Only way for the driver to interact with hardware(eg., I2C sensor, SPI flash, GPIO etc.) is through external handler(user provided).<br>
Drivers are not written with application logic. They are like little lego, You can use it everywhere. Drivers can interact with libraries.<br>
Every driver is written as C++ class within own namespace.

### Libraries

Library is piece of the software with basic logic that does not require interactions with the hardware. Every layer can use libraries. Libraries are not wirtten with application logic.<br>
Eg., library with string manipulation functions.<br>
Every library is written within own namespace.

### Application modules

Application modules combines drivers and libraries to produce basic logic for the application. Module alone is worthless(one plank is not bench, but many planks combined create the bench).<br>
Every module has its own namespace and can be written as many C++ classes.

### Tasks

Tasks combine application modules and their logic to do something useful. In case of bare metal project there is only one task - endless loop in main().

# VERSIONING & NAMING
### Software versioning

- **Library/Driver: vX.Y(rcA)**<br>
  `X` is mayor, `Y` is minor, `rc` stands for `release candidate` which means test release.<br>
  `X`, `Y` and `A` are the numbers. `X` and `Y` can start from 0 while `A` starts from 1.<br>
  `X`, `Y` and `A` cannot go over 99. If `Y` goes over 99, `X` will increase by one and `Y` will reset to zero.<br>
  New features will increase `X` and/or `Y`. It depends on number of features and its size which are introduced with new version.<br>
  If `X` is 0 then it means that software does not contain all features for first full release(beta phase).<br>
  Examples:<br>
  `v0.1rc5` Release candidate #5 for version 0.1.<br>
  `v1.13` Stable release, version 1.13.

- **Firmware: vX.Y.Z(rcA)**<br>
  `X` is mayor, `Y` is minor, `Z` is build and `rc` stands for `release candidate` which means test release.<br>
  `X`, `Y`, `Z` and `A` are the numbers. `X`, `Y` and `Z` can start from 0 while `A` starts from 1.<br>
  `X`, `Y`, `Z` and `A` cannot go over 99.<br>
  Bug fixes and minor updates increase `Z` number while new features increase `Y` number. `X` is increased when `Y` goes over 99.<br>
  If `X` is 0 then it means that software does not contain all features for first full release(beta phase).<br>
  Examples:<br>
  `v0.13.18rc8` Release candidate #8 for version 0.13.18<br>
  `v13.12.0` Stable release, version 13.12.0

### Build naming

This rule applies to naming build executables files(.bin and .hex).<br>
Naming rule is: **{fw_name}\_{fw_version}(_{HW})**<br>
Firmware name contains project name and firmware type, eg., `3DCLK-FW` is name of firmware for 3D Clock project. `3DCLK-BL` is name of bootloader for 3D Clock project. Firmware name is max 16 chars long.<br>
Firmware version is copied from software versioning rule.<br>
`_HW` is inserted in case when build is for specific hardware, eg., hardware 22-0091rev1.<br>
Examples:<br>
`3DCLK-FW_v0.13.18rc3` is name of .bin/.hex file for 3D Clock firmware, version 0.13.18, release candidate 3.<br>
`3DCLK-FW_v1.0.5rc1_22-0091rev1` is name of .bin/.hex file for 3D Clock firmware for hardware version 22-0091rev1, firmware version v1.0.5, release candidate 1.

### File naming

Every file is named with first uppercase letter(Main.cpp, not main.cpp).<br>
Files made for C++ have .hpp header file, while C files have .h header file.

# CODE STANDARD

### Indents

I prefer to use tabs for indents, size 4.

### C++ over C!

I prefer to use C++ over C, but only parts of C++ that do not induce overhead(except templates).<br>
Classes, namespaces and enum classes FTW!

### Code layout

This is only basic layout for source and header files. Layout depends on case-to-case and it is prone to changes.

- SourceFile.cpp:
	```cpp
	/**
	* @file SourceFile.cpp
	* @author silvio3105 (www.github.com/silvio3105)
	* @brief This is template source file.
	* 
	* @copyright Copyright (c) 2023, silvio3105
	* 
	*/

	// ----- INCLUDE FILES


	// ----- VARIABLES


	// ----- STATIC FUNCTION DECLARATIONS


	// ----- FUNCTION DEFINITIONS




	// END WITH NEW LINE

	```

- SourceFile.hpp
	```cpp
	/**
	* @file SourceFile.hpp
	* @author silvio3105 (www.github.com/silvio3105)
	* @brief This is template header file.
	* 
	* @copyright Copyright (c) 2023, silvio3105
	* 
	*/

	#ifndef _SOURCEFILE_H_
	#define _SOURCEFILE_H_

	// ----- INCLUDE FILES


	// ----- DEFINES


	// ----- MACRO FUNCTIONS


	// ----- ENUMS


	// ----- TYPEDEFS


	// ----- STRUCTS


	// ----- CLASS


	// ----- EXTERNS


	// ----- NAMESPACES


	// ----- FUNCTION DECLARATIONS


	#endif // _SOURCEFILE_H_


	// END WITH NEW LINE

	```

### Code example

```cpp

/*
This is comment block.
Comment block is multiline comment.
*/

// This is inline comment

#define THIS_IS_MACRO				value
#define THIS_IS_SECOND_MACRO			(THIS_IS_MACRO - 5)

#define __THIS_IS_MACRO_FUNCTION(_arg1, _arg2) \
	(_arg1 - _arg2)

enum: uint8_t
{
	THIS_IS_ENUM1 = 0,
	THIS_IS_ENUM2
} enum_type_t;

typedef void (*ext_handler_f)(void);

struct
{
	uint8_t someVar;
	ext_handler_f someHandler;
} this_is_struct_t;

/**
 * @brief Class brief.
 * 
 * Class description.
 */
class ThisIsClass
{
	public:
	ThisIsClass(void);
	~ThisIsClass(void);

	private:
	uint16_t someArray[] = "Array";

	inline void someFunction(void);
};

extern volatile someVaraible;

uint32_t thisIsVariable = 0; /**< @brief This is inline doxygen comment. */

/**
 * @brief Function brief.
 * 
 * Function description.
 * 
 * @param argOne Some argument.
 * @param argsList Some argument.
 * @param varRef Some argument.
 * 
 * @return No return value.
 */
void someFunction(const uint8_t argOne, uint16_t* argsList, uint32_t& varRef);

namespace SomeNameSpace
{
	// VARIABLES
	uint64_t x;

	// FUNCTIONS
	void setFoo(char someChar);
}

```

### Code workflow comments

For some reason I like to add bunch of "workflow comments".
Workflow comments describe what lines below (comment) do. I tend to "group" lines of code into little sections.

```cpp
void foo(void)
{
	float tmp = 0;
	uint16_t x = 1;
	char str[32] = { '\0' };
	uint32_t* ptr = nullptr;

	// Execute something with value x
	exe(x);

	// Calculate result and convert it
	foo2(ptr, x);
	tmp = 2.00f * (*ptr);

	// Do something with value
	if (tmp > 10.00f) tmp = 10.00f;
		else tmp -= 0.55f;

	// Check does string exist
	if (str[0])
	{
		// Do something with string		
	}
	else return; // String does not exist, abort

	// Rest of the function...

}
```

### Nested if statments?

I prefer less nested code. If I can check requirments before function does its job, I do it.

Short examples:
```cpp
void foo(void)
{
	// Check if device is online
	if (isOnline())
	{
		// Check if data is ready
		if (isReady())
		{
			// Send data
			bar();
			bar2();
		}
		else print("Not ready\n");
	}
	else print("Not online\n");
}
```

```cpp
void foo(void)
{
	// Check if device is online
	if (!isOnline())
	{
		print("Not online\n");

		// Abort
		return;
	}

	// Check if data is ready
	if (!isReady())
	{
		print("Not ready\n");

		// Abort
		return:	
	}

	// Send data
	bar();
	bar2();
}
```
